### Supervised Machine Learning

---

#### Training Data
* Target Variable
* Label
* Observations
* Features

#### Classification? or  Regression?

---

| Classification | Regression |
| -------- | -------- |
|Category | Continuous |

---

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

---

UL is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns patterns from unlabelled data, i.e., "without a teacher," like and unsupervised pupil

---

| Clustering| Anomaly Detection  | Association |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Group Similarities | I.D. Outliers | Make Suggestions |

---

### Reinforcement Learning

---

#### Deciding sequential actions

#### Less Common Theory
Uses complex mathematics
